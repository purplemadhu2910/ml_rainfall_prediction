# ml_rainfall_prediction

Predicting rainfall is a vital aspect of weather forecasting, agriculture planning and water resource management. In this article, we will use the Linear regression algorithm that helps establish a relationship between two variables: one dependent (rainfall) and one or more independent variables (temperature, humidity). It tells us how many inches of rainfall we can expect.
